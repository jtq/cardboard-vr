# Prototype VR Instant-Win Game for Google Cardboard

Basic demo of a Google Cardboard v2-compatible match-3-symbols instant-win game translated into a web-based VR game, using THREE.js for the 3D rendering and the device orientation API (on mobile) or click-and-drag (on desktop) for navigation.

A live demo is available at [http://jtq.github.io/cardboard-vr/](http://jtq.github.io/cardboard-vr/).  The red dot in the middle of each eye's viewport is the cursor.  As per Google Cardboard v2 hardware, the red square in the centre-top of the screen is the interaction button.

## Code Portfolio Note

This game prototype is designed to work on all modern smartphones and desktop/laptops, optionally using a Google Cardboard v2 device (low-cost VR viewer) to present a different view to each eye, giving a full 3D effect.  Implemented using web technologies it requires no installation or special apps/privileges to run, and was designed as a custom UI/theme that could be run on top of existing IWG game engines, allowing it to slot straight into existing web-based instant-win games delivery systems with no retooling necessary on the server-side, or installation on the client-side.

When initially written it was an industry-first in the lottery/casino instant-win games industry, and at the time of writing (some 18 months later) it is apparently still unique, with no other companies in this space have announced or demonstrated anything comparable.
