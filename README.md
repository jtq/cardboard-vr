VR for Google Cardboard using THREE.js

Basic demo of a Google Cardboard v2-compatible match-3-symbols instant-win game translated into a web-based VR game, using THREE.js for the 3D rendering and the device orientation API (on mobile) or click-and-drag (on desktop) for navigation.

A demo is available at [http://jtq.github.io/cardboard-vr/](http://jtq.github.io/cardboard-vr/).  The red dot in the middle of each eye's viewport is the cursor.  As per Google Cardboard v2 hardware, the red square in the centre-top of the screen is the interaction button.
